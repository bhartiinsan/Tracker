#Operators
'''
Operators are special symbols and keywords use to perform different types of operations like 
arithmetic, comparison, logical, searching, deleting, etc. on operands

operand is the data in the form of either value or variable or expression

based on number of operands, there are 3 categories of operators




'''

a=10
b=4
c= a+b
# ARITHMETIC ADDITION
print(a+b) # minus point you are ahead in writing code and you need to show the output again
print(c)    # it is stored in value and resue



# ARITHMETIC SUBTRACTION
print(a-b)
print(b-a)

# ARITHMETIC MULTIPLICATION
print(a*b)
print(b*a)

# EXPONENT/POWER OPERATOR
print(a**b)  # a^b

#  TRUE DIVISION
print(a/b) # forward slash # WHERE ACCURACY MATTER

# to ignore floor value FLOOR DIVISION  # WHERE ACCURACY NOT MATTER

print(a//b)

# FLOOR DIVISION
print(a%b) # modulus/ remainder division , FOR EXAMPLE A DIVIDE BY B THEN REMAINDER IS 0

# WHAT IS HASHING

#PRICE % 5 -- REMAINING REMAINDER USE TO PUT IN RACK LABELED 1-5


a=2+3*4 # first all sequence is perform, presedence of arithmetic operator
print(a)

a= (2+3)*4  # VV.VIP USE BRACKET()
print(a)


a=2*3**4
print(a)

print(10//2)
print(10/2)


a=10/5*2
print(a)








a= 2**3**2  # 2**(3**2)  # 2**9 = 512   # right to left associativity of exponentiation operator

print(a)













# QUES 1
p= 8
c=8
m=9
k= p+c+m
avg = k/3 # (k/3)   # they are average of number of count
print(avg)

#Ques 2
# a^3 + b^3 + 3 a^2b + 3 ab^2
numb = c
a = a**3 + b**3 + 3*a**2*b + 3*a*b**2
sum= c*a
print(numb,sum)

##=------------------
a=2
b=3
r=a**3 + b**3 + 3 * (a*2)
print(r)


a=2
b=3
r=(a**3)+(b**3)+3*(a**2)*b+3*a*(b**2)
print(r)

# or avg=(p+c+m)/3
